## 📖 About the Project

The Nobel Prize, established in 1895 by Alfred Nobel, is one of the world's most prestigious awards, recognizing excellence in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economics.  
This project explores the official Nobel Prize dataset (1901–2023) to uncover fascinating patterns: gender disparities, geographic dominance, and historical trends.

Using **Python** and data visualization libraries, we answer key questions about Nobel laureates and generate insightful charts.  
Perfect for data enthusiasts, students, and anyone curious about scientific history.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Explore gender, birth country, and decade-wise trends.  
- **Beautiful Visualizations:** Interactive charts with Seaborn & Matplotlib (gender distribution, USA ratio, female heatmap).  
- **Insightful Results:** Answers to 5 core questions, including the first female winner and repeat laureates.  
- **Robust Code:** Handles data inconsistencies (e.g., column mismatches) automatically.  
- **Clear Documentation:** Easy to understand and extend.
